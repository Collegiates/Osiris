This project is an AI-powered coding practice platform designed to help developers and technical interview candidates improve more effectively by focusing on their weakest areas. Rather than having users randomly select problems or rely on full solutions, the platform begins with a coding assessment to identify skill gaps. Based on the assessment results, the system generates a personalized roadmap of coding problems tailored to each user’s needs. It tracks progress over time, including completed problems, time spent, and performance patterns, and uses this data to continuously refine problem recommendations. AI is used as a learning guide, not a solver, by helping users understand how to approach problems and what to practice next, without directly providing answers. The primary goal is to make interview preparation and skill development more efficient by ensuring users practice the right problems at the right time.

We’re building an AI-driven coding assessment tool that helps developers practice more effectively by generating personalized coding problems based on their weaknesses.

Al will be used to recommend problems and create a roadmap to help the user improve with their technical skills.

Our core feature for the demo will be the roadmap generation based on the assessment.

roadmap can be dynamic by adding more questions or question variations if it sees you struggling on the topic.
for the demo we can have answers ready to paste in and point out intentional errors and see how the ai builds the roadmap around the errors that we put in
